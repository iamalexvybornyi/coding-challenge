**Coding Challenge Task:**
```
Q: Given the below array `nums` of size `n`, write a function to return the majority element:
nums = [2,1,2,2,1,3,3]
The majority element is the element that appears the most of the time in the array. You may
assume that the majority element always exists in the array.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,2,4]
Output: 4
Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,3,1,1,1,3,3]
Output: 3
```
